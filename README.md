## Epic Seven Automatic Gear Score Calculator

[![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

An automatic gear score calculator for the game called *Epic Seven*. The program uses an OCR Library from **IronOCR**. Simply screenshot your gear stats using snipping tool then paste it on the window, the program will automatically detect stats of the gear and calculate its score.

## Formula

For Level 85 gear (before reforge):

*ATK% + HP% + DEF% + EFF% + ER% + (CC% × 1.6) + (CD% × 1.1) + (SPD × 2) + (Flat ATK / 10) + (Flat HP / 50) + (Flat DEF / 6)*
