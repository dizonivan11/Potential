## Epic Seven Automatic Gear Score Calculator

An automatic gear score calculator for the game called *Epic Seven* that uses an OCR Library from **IronOCR**. Simply screenshot your gear stats using snipping tool then paste it on the window, the program will automatically detect stats of the gear and calculate its score.

### Formula used for Level 85 gear (before reforge):

*ATK% + HP% + DEF% + EFF% + ER% + (CC% × 1.6) + (CD% × 1.1) + (SPD × 2) + (Flat ATK / 10) + (Flat HP / 50) + (Flat DEF / 6)*

> Currently WIP, program only calculates Level 85 Epic gears regardless of what you pick on the drop-down and also fixing some inaccurate reading
