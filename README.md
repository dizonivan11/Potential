## Epic Seven Automatic Gear Score Calculator

An automatic gear score calculator for the game called *Epic Seven* that uses an OCR Library from **IronOCR**. Simply screenshot your gear stats using snipping tool then paste it on the window, the program will automatically detect stats of the gear and calculate its score.

For Level 85 gear (before reforge):

*ATK% + HP% + DEF% + EFF% + ER% + (CC% × 1.6) + (CD% × 1.1) + (SPD × 2) + (Flat ATK / 10) + (Flat HP / 50) + (Flat DEF / 6)*
